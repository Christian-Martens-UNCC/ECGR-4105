A summary of the project and its broader impact:
League of Legends is the most popular MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) video game in the world. Its developer, Riot Games, is a multi-million dollar corporation that thrives off of the game’s commercial and competitive success. In MOBA video games, two teams compete against one another to be the first to complete an objective, with each player controlling a unique character called a “champion”. Before a match can begin, each team must select five champions to play, one for each player on the team. This is called the “draft” or “champion select” phase of the game, and the impact this phase has on the rest of the game is hard to understate. Having a good draft phase can give a team a huge advantage during the game, whereas having a poor draft phase can doom a team’s chances of winning before the match begins. Optimizing this portion of the game would lead to a noticeable increase in the winning percentage of high performance clubs which would boost the profits from apparel revenue and sponsorship deals.
